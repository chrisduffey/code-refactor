# code-refactor

## Refactor HTML and CSS for a web deployment

Description
- Show graders that we can clone our file to our machine and to git hub
- Our task is to improve the accessibility standards of site
- Replcing the <div> elements for semantic elements to have a better understanding of the structure of coding
- Understand flow of coding to make logical structures
- Add alt attributes that give descriptions to images for site accessibility
-Make a page for the graders to view

What I learned
- How to properly use git hub to clone files, add, commit, and push
- the importance of semantic elements and how they time save while coding
- Understany why structures properly flow
- purpose for alt attributes for viewers with disabilites 
- make and deploy a page in git hub





## User Story
* AS A marketing agency
* I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
* SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Critera

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mock-Up


(![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page](<assets/images/mockup img.png>))

**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
